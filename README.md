# bWAPP Contest Starting Code v2.2

This is the base source code of the bWAPPv2.2 from itsecgames.com. 
To ensure consistency use this code base from here and not from itsecgames in case they change anything.

There is an alternative bee-box download which is a 1.2GB vitual Linux box that has the app fully installed. For this contest this is not allowed, you must download and install the app yourself. 

You will use the Sonarqube implementation for all scanning. (As this is a public GIT go see internal posts for the URL and other internal discussion in the Security channel)

First team to a passing scan, wins.

bWAPP, or a buggy web application, is a deliberately insecure web application.
bWAPP helps security enthusiasts, developers and students to discover and to prevent web vulnerabilities.
It prepares one to conduct successful penetration testing and ethical hacking projects.
What makes bWAPP so unique? Well, it has over 100 web bugs!
bWAPP covers all major known web vulnerabilities, including all risks from the OWASP Top 10 project!
It is for security-testing and educational purposes only.

It includes:
 
*/ Injection vulnerabilities like SQL, SSI, XML/XPath, JSON, LDAP, HTML, iFrame, OS Command and SMTP injection

*/ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Tracing (XST) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

*/ Unrestricted file uploads and backdoor files

*/ Authentication, authorization and session management issues

*/ Arbitrary file access and directory traversals

*/ Local and remote file inclusions (LFI/RFI)

*/ Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

*/ XML External Entity Attacks (XXE)

*/ Heartbleed vulnerability (OpenSSL)

*/ Shellshock vulnerability (CGI)

*/ Drupal SQL injection (Drupageddon)

*/ Configuration issues: Man-in-the-Middle, cross-domain policy file, information disclosures,...

*/ HTTP parameter pollution and HTTP response splitting

*/ Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks

*/ HTML5 ClickJacking, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and web storage issues

*/ Unvalidated redirects and forwards

bWAPP is a PHP application that uses a MySQL database. It can be hosted on Linux and Windows using Apache/IIS and MySQL. It can be installed with WAMP or XAMPP.

It's also possible to download our bee-box, a custom VM pre-installed with bWAPP.

This project is part of the ITSEC GAMES project. ITSEC GAMES are a fun approach to IT security education. 
IT security, ethical hacking, training and fun... all mixed together.
You can find more about the ITSEC GAMES and bWAPP projects on our blog.

We offer a 2-day comprehensive web security course 'Attacking & Defending Web Apps with bWAPP'.
This course can be scheduled on demand, at your location!
